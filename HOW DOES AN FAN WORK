<h1>How a Fan Works</h1>

<p>A fan works by using the rotation of blades to create airflow, which helps to circulate air and cool down the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Main Components:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blades:</strong> The blades are mounted on a central hub and are angled to create airflow when rotated.</li>
  <li><strong>Motor:</strong> The motor provides the power to rotate the blades.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing:</strong> The housing surrounds the blades and motor, directing the airflow and providing stability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operation:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The motor provides power to the fan, causing the blades to rotate.</li>
  <li>As the blades rotate, they push air in the direction they are facing.</li>
  <li>The angled design of the blades creates a pressure difference, causing air to move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.</li>
  <li>This movement of air creates airflow, which helps to cool down the surrounding environment.</li>
  <li>The housing of the fan helps to direct the airflow in a specific direction and provides stability to the fan.</li>
</ol>

<p>This process continues as long as the fan is powered on, providing continuous airflow to the surrounding area.</p>
